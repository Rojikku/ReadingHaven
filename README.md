Reading Haven Chrome Extension
It's a chrome extension I have arbitrarily named "Reading Haven".
This is a sort of alpha phase, it may expand, it may not. Currently, it works great reading on royalroadl.com.

Features:
Read posts in a nice, easy sight format.
Bookmarks! Highlight some text, and press enter. You made a bookmark! As long as you're in reading mode and the web address is the same, it will show up. You can erase it at any time on that page with the button F7.

F.A.Q.
"Why'd you make this Chrome Extension?"
My personal convenience. To share. Because I couldn't find one like it.
